## :point_right: Thanks for being a Tensorflow user, please read and help with a quick survey 


The TensorFlow team is working on building/improving features, and understands that it is very important to prioritize these efforts based on what TF users need. 

The goal of this short, < 5min **[survey](https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_d5nqhCEbkDkQ7ad).**, is to help the TensorFlow team better understand what features to prioritize based on your feedback.
